Smart Blind Stick
Description:
The Smart Blind Stick is an assistive device designed to help visually impaired individuals navigate their surroundings more safely. This stick uses sensors to detect obstacles and water on the path. When an obstacle is near, it triggers a buzzer and a vibrating motor to alert the user. The goal is to provide a reliable tool that enables blind individuals to move with greater confidence.

Features:
Obstacle Detection: The stick detects nearby objects and obstacles.
Water Detection: Alerts the user when there’s water on the ground.
Vibration and Sound Alerts: Provides real-time feedback with vibrations and sounds, making it easy for users to respond quickly to hazards.
Components Used:
Ultrasonic Sensor: Detects obstacles in front of the user by measuring distance.
Buzzer: Emits a sound to warn the user of obstacles.
Vibration Motor: Vibrates to provide an additional alert for nearby hazards.
Water Sensor: Detects water on the ground, sending a signal when water is present.
Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino): The central unit controlling the device’s sensors and alerts.
How It Works:
The ultrasonic sensor continuously checks for objects in front of the stick. When it detects an obstacle within a set range, it activates the buzzer and the vibration motor. Similarly, if the water sensor detects moisture, it triggers an alert to notify the user
